Masters dissertation project: Othello AI player 

AI algorithms implemented:

Minimax (Standard minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Negamax) and Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Also included multithreaded implementations of the algorithms. Need improvement and tweaking in order to overcome thread problems related to the recursive nature of the minimax algorithm.
